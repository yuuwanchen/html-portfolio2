    <h3>Little Women</h3>
    <p> The story is mainly talking about the life of four sisters in the Civil War era. They are very close to each other and always support each other. The story is very touching and inspiring. I like the character Jo the most, she is very independent and brave. She is also very talented in writing. The movie is very well made, the costumes and sets are very beautiful. The acting is also very good, especially Saoirse Ronan who plays Jo. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.</p>
